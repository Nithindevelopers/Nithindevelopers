    <h2>Building Success Stories</h2>
    <p>
      At <strong>Nithin Developers</strong>, every project we support becomes a story of trust, efficiency, and collaboration. 
      We are proud to be the silent backbone of countless residential homes, commercial complexes, interior makeovers, and advisory projects. 
      Hereâ€™s a detailed look at the type of work weâ€™ve been part of.
    </p>

    <!-- Residential Projects -->
    <div class="project-block">
      <img src="images/project-residential.jpg" alt="Residential Projects">
      <h3>Residential Projects</h3>
      <p>
        Homes are the foundation of our work. Over the years, we have supplied materials for apartments, independent villas, 
        and affordable housing projects across Tamil Nadu. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Apartments:</strong> Providing tiles, plumbing, and electricals for high-rise projects in Chennai and Coimbatore.</li>
        <li><strong>Villas:</strong> Premium interiors, flooring, and fittings tailored for luxury homes in Coimbatore and Madurai.</li>
        <li><strong>Affordable Housing:</strong> Supplying durable, cost-effective materials for budget housing in Avadi, Trichy, and Salem.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Whether itâ€™s a compact 2BHK or a large gated community, our timely deliveries and reliable pricing ensure smooth project completion.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Commercial Projects -->
    <div class="project-block">
      <img src="images/project-commercial.jpg" alt="Commercial Projects">
      <h3>Commercial Projects</h3>
      <p>
        Commercial projects require durability and design appeal. We have been part of supplying for offices, showrooms, 
        and industrial facilities that demand the highest standards of performance.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Corporate Offices:</strong> Electrical fittings, flooring, and modular partitions for professional setups.</li>
        <li><strong>Retail Spaces:</strong> Designer tiles, lighting, and interiors that attract customers and enhance brand image.</li>
        <li><strong>Industrial Facilities:</strong> Heavy-duty materials built to withstand long-term use and strict safety compliance.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        With us, developers donâ€™t just get materials â€“ they get peace of mind knowing their project is backed by consistency and reliability.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Interior Projects -->
    <div class="project-block">
      <img src="images/project-interiors.jpg" alt="Interior Projects">
      <h3>Interior Projects</h3>
      <p>
        A well-designed interior transforms spaces. We provide materials that help create stylish, functional, and long-lasting interiors.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Modular Kitchens:</strong> Cabinets, laminates, fittings, and backsplash tiles.</li>
        <li><strong>Wardrobes & Storage:</strong> Stylish finishes and durable panels for modern storage solutions.</li>
        <li><strong>Office Interiors:</strong> Gypsum ceilings, partitions, and lighting to create productive workspaces.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        From homes to offices, our interior support ensures the end product is as practical as it is beautiful.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Advisory Projects -->
    <div class="project-block">
      <img src="images/project-advisory.jpg" alt="Advisory & Sourcing">
      <h3>Advisory & Sourcing Support</h3>
      <p>
        Many clients approach us not just for materials but for guidance. Our advisory role involves helping them choose the right 
        materials, balancing cost with quality, and sourcing rare items.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Requirement Analysis:</strong> Helping clients understand exactly what they need.</li>
        <li><strong>Cost Optimization:</strong> Negotiating better prices through our supplier network.</li>
        <li><strong>Custom Sourcing:</strong> Finding rare products or alternatives when needed.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This role has saved our clients significant money and time, making Nithin Developers not just a trader but a trusted consultant.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Client Success Stories -->
    <div class="project-block">
      <h3>Client Success Stories</h3>
      <p>
        A residential developer in Avadi once approached us struggling to source affordable bathroom fittings. 
        Through our supplier connections, we helped them save 18% on costs without compromising on quality.  
      </p>
      <p>
        In Coimbatore, we assisted a commercial builder in sourcing certified electrical wiring that passed stringent safety checks, 
        ensuring their project was completed on time and with full compliance.  
      </p>
      <p>
        These are just two examples of how our expertise translates into real value for our clients.
