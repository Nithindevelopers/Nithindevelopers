    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Nithin Developers</strong> was founded with a simple mission: to solve the sourcing challenges faced in the 
      construction industry. Contractors were juggling multiple suppliers, homeowners were overwhelmed by choices, 
      and builders were losing time and money on unreliable vendors. We decided to step in and make sourcing smarter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Starting in Avadi, Chennai, we built strong networks with suppliers, distributors, and manufacturers. 
      Today, we stand as one of Tamil Naduâ€™s most reliable names in construction material outsourcing and trading.
    </p>

    <h2>Mission & Vision</h2>
    <p>
      Our mission is clear: provide builders, developers, and homeowners with access to the right materials at the 
      right time and the right price. We want to remove the stress of procurement and bring transparency to the 
      construction industry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our vision is to become a leading outsourcing and trading partner across India, known for trust, 
      affordability, and reliability.
    </p>
